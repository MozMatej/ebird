This repo has some ebird tinkering. For now, just a script to comb through recent sightings json (see sample.json) and cross-compare against life-, year-, or location-list (see johnath.csv) to find notables.

This is the API to grab recent observations in a particular location - https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird-1.1-RecentNearbyObservations
